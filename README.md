## Project 3
This project was to build a neural net (and a few other methods) to analyze image data. I built the basic ANN. The other parts did not require building from scratch and you could use libraries.

## Project 4
This project involved conservation efforts. Here we tried to sort data and predict movement patterns of birds. This is not an easy task but when we narrowed down our domain we were able to achieve interesting results.
